Hi! I'm Zhenis — a backend engineer with a love for building fast, reliable systems. With 7+ years of experience, I’ve worked on everything from microservices and real-time pipelines to observability tools powered by LLMs.

I’ve mostly been writing Go (with some Python and NodeJS), working with Kafka, ClickHouse, Postgres, and building event-driven systems in production. I care about clean code, smart monitoring, and making services easier to debug and scale.

Lately, I've been exploring ways to bring AI into infrastructure — like summarizing logs or finding hidden patterns with LLMs.

Open to backend-focused roles in Houston (or remote). Let’s build something awesome 🚀
